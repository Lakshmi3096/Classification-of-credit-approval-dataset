# Classification-of-credit-approval-dataset
Automatic credit card approval is the essential technique applied in banking sector. The goal of our project is to build a machine to perform credit approval on the dataset which has been encrypted for security purpose. This project deals with the binary classification of the data, that is, whether to approve or decline credit card request. Na√Øve Bayes classification with Laplacian smoothing is used for this purpose. Furthermore, the classifier characteristics like precision, recall and F-measure are analyzed. ROC curve is also plotted within the reasonable cutoff.
